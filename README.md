# Y-intercept-Calculator
Cool widget for calculating y intercepts


Directions
Place the graphics.py file (available from http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/) in the same location where you will create your program.

Write a program that computes the intersection of a circle with a horizontal line and displays the information textually and graphically.
Input: Radius of the circle and the y-intercept of the line. Prompt the user for these values.

Output: Draw a circle centered at (0,0) with the given radius in a window with coordinates running from (–10,–10) to (10,10).

Draw a horizontal line across the window with the given y-intercept.

Draw the two points of intersection in red.

Print out the x values of the points of intersection in the upper left-hand corner of the window.
Formula for the intersection values of x:

where r is the radius and y is the y-intercept.

When the user clicks anywhere on the window, it should close.
